### Project Goal:

In this project, Microsoft is establishing a new movie studio. I will use data analysis to advise Microsoft Studio (“MS”) toward a business plan that will increase gross domestic revenue.  
 
 
### Data Source and Data Exploration:

This data derives from three largest available online databases – IMBd, The numbers, and Mojo Box office – from the years 2010-2018.  During this time period, successful movie studios accumulated more than 100 billion dollars, a testament to the growing public interest in film culture and industry. 

### Method: 

The analysis was coded using Python - focusing on Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib visualization. 
 
 
My data consisted of 15 columns and 13,376 rows. 
 
### Conclusion: 

I have determined that the best predictors of profitability for a given film are budget, release month, genre, cast and crew and movie length.
